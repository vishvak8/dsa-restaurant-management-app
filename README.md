# Restaurant Management System (with DSA Integration)

This is a simple web application built using **Python Flask** to simulate basic restaurant operations like table booking, order placement, billing, and sales reporting — all powered by custom-built **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

The goal was to apply core computer science concepts such as queues, stacks, linked lists, trees, and sorting algorithms in a real-world scenario, rather than just implementing them in isolation.

## What the project does

- Allows users to book tables based on real-time availability  
- Accepts food orders and manages them in a queue  
- Handles billing with support for cash/card payments and tip calculations  
- Generates end-of-day reports with completed order details  
- Sorts menu items using a custom implementation of **Merge Sort**

---

## Tech and Concepts Used

- **Backend**: Python with Flask  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Jinja2 templating)  
- **Data Structures**:
  - Queue for managing order flow
  - Stack for order reversal
  - Tree for menu categorization
  - Linked List for item tracking
- **Algorithm**:
  - Merge Sort to sort items by price or name

## Why I built this

This project was originally part of a Data Structures and Algorithms assignment. I wanted to go beyond basic coding exercises and build a real-world working application. Every booking, order, and billing operation is powered by custom-built data structures like queues, stacks, trees, and linked lists. This helped me bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical implementation.
